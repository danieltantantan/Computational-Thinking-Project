# Computational-Thinking-Project
Created a solution for a travelling salesman problem. As an NP-hard problem, the solution was created with a points/distance ratio followed by a Two Opt to obtain the shortest distance yet highest points.

For the multiple player problem, I did KMeans clustering first. A player then only visited points in the cluster with the highest points/distance ratio to him.
